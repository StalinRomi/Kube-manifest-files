Kubernetes is an open source **Container Management tool / Orchestration tool** which automates container deployment, container scaling and load balancing. It **schedules, runs and manages** isolated containers which are running on Virtual / Physical / Cloud machines.

## Why Kubernetes was adopted worldwide?

1. Trend from Monolithic to **Microservices**.

2. Increased usage of **containers**.

3. Demand for a proper way of managing hundreds of containers.

## Manifest (Yaml file)

Here, we write the **desired things**. It will have - apiversion, Kind (Defines what O/P we need), Metadata(Gives names & attaches labels to Pods), spec(specifications about the kind).

## Kubernetes Objects

Kubernetes uses objects to represent the **state of your cluster** -> which containerized applications are running and in which state. Objects are identified by Unique Name or **UID**.
